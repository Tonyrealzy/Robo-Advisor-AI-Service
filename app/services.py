I am {} years old and I live in {}. I consider myself a {} in terms of investment and I wish to invest

I have a sum of {} in {} to invest. Which specific financial products ( including ticker and provider
would a typical financial advisor recommend for investment given my circumstances? You may limit the number of recommendations to a minimum of five.
You may also add an estimate of the expected return from each recommendation.
Environmental factors are not important to me when I am investing. Which composition
(as a percentage) would he recommend for each financial product?
Each recommendation should be a proportion of '100%' of the amount to be invested. I will not consider your response personalizedÂ advice.
You may send the response in json format, let the key to the recommendations be given as recommendations,
and each key in the recommendation should be represented as ("financial_product", "ticker", "provider", "brief_description", "expected_return", "composition") and also ensure that composition comes last in the json.
